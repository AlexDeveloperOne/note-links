#### Estrutura do Past Continuous:

O **Past Continuous** é usado para falar sobre ações que estavam em andamento em um determinado momento no passado. A estrutura básica é:

**Sujeito + was/were + verbo com -ing**

| Sujeito   | Verbo "to be" no passado | Verbo principal |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| I         | was                      | playing         |
| You       | were                     | studying        |
| He/She/It | was                      | working         |

#### Afirmativas:

- I was reading a book.
